# IMAP Dump

Save everything in an IMAP account to the local machine. It can also be used for
extracting attachments.

All IMAP folders and their email contents are replicated in the current working
directory.  The script can easily be modified to only save attachments.

## Usage

Edit the login credentials at the top of the script and then run:

    python2 imap-dump.py
